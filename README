(Y)et (A)nother (COM)ment is a vim commenting plugin with an extremely minimalist approach. It has only one keybind (default `<leader>c`) to toggle the comment (i.e. comment if not commented, uncomment otherwise) the current line (normal mode) or the selected line(s) (visual mode).

See https://github.com/gokcehan/vim-yacom for more information.
